<b>Planning:</b>
<br></br> 
To document this Account Infrastructure Profile, first identify how many 
distinct environments exist for this account. Consider multiple locations, multiple sectors, 
or divisions to be covered by this account. Enter any infrastructure facts for this specific account 
only (unless the sales rep or sales manager directs otherwise).
<br></br><br></br>
<b>Creating Environments:</b>
<br></br> 
Next, determine which environments have similar attributes (such as hardware, software) that you can combine 
into one environment. Otherwise, enter each environment separately.
<br></br><br></br>
<b>Naming the individual environments:</b>
<br></br>
Plan a naming convention for the different profiles. Recommended: Name the 
environment with the internal name that the account uses for that infrastructure area. 
Example: Environment name _location_SA last name.
